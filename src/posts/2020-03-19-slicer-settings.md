## What is a slicer?


## 1. Adjusting the first layer

I usually adjust a few parameters for the first layer.

* Bump up the extrution width for the first layer only.
* Lower the first layer speed (gives the filament more time to heat up)
* Raise the temperature of the head bed by around 5 degrees

## 2. Construction support

I usually print with a _skirt_ but especially for larger constructions I switch to a _brim_.
