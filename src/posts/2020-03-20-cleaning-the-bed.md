If prints are not sticking to the print surface properly that might be a sign that the bed is dirty. Time to clean it! Bad adhesion comes from oil, dirt or stuck filament particles.

Before you start:

* _Make sure the bed is cooled down, not heated._

## 1. Remove chunks of filament with scraper

Grab the scraper that comes with the printer and **remove any remaining filament from the print surface**.

## 2. Clean the bed with a solvent

70% Isoproponal alcohol works fine. **Grab a microfiber, put some solvent on it and wipe down the bed.**
