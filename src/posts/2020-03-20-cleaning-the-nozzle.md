If the hotend doesn't properly let filament trough it might indicate that the Nozzle is _clogged_. Signs that indicate this are; the extruder motor is struggling to get filament trough, prints that are more air then material or the material _curls_ after leaving the nozzle.

Before you start cleaning:

* _Preheat the Nozzle to your standard temperature_
* _Raise the z-axis to eye-height_
* _Pull out the filament from the teflon tube with the extruder_

## 1. Put a needle trough the Nozzle

Your printer will most likely come with a small needle that fits the nozzle (typically 0.4mm). **Put the needle into the Nozzle and move it up and down a few times**.

## 2. Clean filament off with a brush

Remove the plastic cover of the hotend to expose the hotend and nozzle. **Brush the plastic off with a Copper Brush in one smooth forward and backwards motion.**
