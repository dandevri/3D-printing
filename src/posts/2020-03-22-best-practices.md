## Keep the workspace clean

Wipe it down a few times. You don't want to have dust.

## Don't cook the filament in the Nozzle

Don't leave the hotend on for a extended period of time, the filament is slowly going to decompose into a plastic mess. Simply turn off the hot-end when the machine is idle.
